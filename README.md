#  RichtlijnenBetaVersion

This is a Youth Guidelines app that is aimed at the target group of care providers, parents and young people who want insights into the Guidelines of https://richtlijnenjeugdhulp.nl/. The app supports IOS14 and higher.

An employee of the organization Altra in Amsterdam who recently graduated as a youth care worker approached me with the question if I can develop an ios app where it is easy to know for the user which youth guidelines can be applied in a specific situation / problem.

The Beta version of the app will be presented on Wednesday 11 August to several employees who have been employed by Altra for a longer period. If they are satisfied with the product, it will be placed in the app store as soon as possible and 2 important functions will be added:

-    The option to use the app in more languages than just Dutch.
-    The option to save a selected Guideline in case the user needs it more than one time.
